# GET HERE

You have three nearby airport options for flying in:
- LEX, in Lexington
- SDF, in Louisville
- CVG, in Northern Kentucky

LEX is obviously the closest airport, but it’s sometimes hard to find good flights and/or rates, and you’ll probably still want to rent a car anyway (it’s pretty far out of town, and Lexington’s public transportation system is, unfortunately, not great).

SDF and CVG are both about an hour-and-fifteen-minute drive from Lexington, and generally have similar flights and rates. Either drive is pretty, taking you through Central Kentucky’s rolling hills and beautiful horse farms. Enjoy the majestic Bluegrass!

If you need radio station suggestions for the drive, or would like a “Welcome to Kentucky” mix CD to make the drive more pleasant, give us a shout!
