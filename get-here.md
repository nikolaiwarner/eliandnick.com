## FLY
***
You have three nearby airport options for flying in:
- [LEX](http://www.bluegrassairport.com/), in Lexington
- [SDF](http://www.flylouisville.com/), in Louisville
- [CVG](http://www.cvgairport.com/), in Northern Kentucky (Cincinnati)

LEX is obviously the closest airport, but it’s sometimes hard to find good flights and/or rates, and you’ll probably still want to rent a car anyway (it’s pretty far out of town, and Lexington’s public transportation system is, unfortunately, not great).

SDF and CVG are both about an hour-and-fifteen-minute drive from Lexington, and generally have similar flights and rates. Either drive is pretty, taking you through Central Kentucky’s rolling hills and beautiful horse farms. Enjoy the majestic Bluegrass!

## DRIVE
***
Lexington literally sits at the intersections of two major interstates - I64 (east-west) and I75 (north-south). 
- From __64E (aka Louisville):__ our favorite way to get into town is to take exit 65 (marked US-62 Midway/Versailles). Once off the exit ramp, turn right, and then when the road ends, turn left. This is Highway 421. Once you've made the turn, make sure to look to your right - that first farm, in addition to the usual farm animals, is home to a herd of buffalo and a CAMEL! Stay on 421 basically all the way into town - it turns into Leestown Rd, and then eventually Main St. If you're staying at the Griffin Gate, you'll turn left at Newtown Pike (big intersection right after the cemetary). Springhill Suites or Holiday Inn - turn right at Broadway (just after the convention center).
- From __64W:__ after you pass Winchester, KY, there will be a confusing mess of interstate where 64 and 75 come together. Continue on 64W/75N (signs should say toward Louisville and Cincinnati). If you're staying at Springhill Suites or the Holiday Inn Express, you'll want to get off at Exit 113 (which is Broadway). Griffin Gate, use Exit 115 (which is Newtown Pike).
- From __75S (aka Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky):__ our favorite way is to take Exit 120 (marked Co. Road 1973/Ironworks Pike and is right at the Kentucky Horse Park). At the end of the exit ramp, turn left. You'll pass the Horse Park on the left. Wave to the horses! Continue until you reach an intersection with a flashing stop light (basically, the first "big" intersection you come to). Here, turn right onto Newtown Pike. This will take you all the way into town. If you're at the Griffin Gate, you'll see your hotel on the left right after you pass under the interstate. Springhill Suites and Holiday Inn Express - continue on Newtown Pike until you hit Main Street - turn left, and then turn right at Broadway.
- From __75N:__ after you cross over the Kentucky River, you'll start seeing signs for Lexington. The highway will merge with 64 just before your exits - make sure to stay on 75N/64W. Springhill Suites/Holiday Inn Expressers - take Exit 113 (Broadway). Griffin Gaters - take Exit 115 (Newtown Pike).

- From the __Lexington airport:__ when you exit the airport, turn left onto Man O War Boulevard. Fairly soon after, turn right onto Versailles Rd. Take Versailles all the way into town. If you're at the Springhill Suites or Holiday Inn Express, it will be easiest for you to turn right at Red Mile Rd (and you'll get to go past the wedding site!). The intersection with Broadway is the next major intersection. Springhill Suites - turn left at Broadway, and it's almost immediately on your left. Holiday Inn Express - continue on past Broadway (the road becomes Virginia Ave.), and you should see the hotel very soon after on your right. For the Griffin Gate - when you suddenly see the downtown skyline pop up, be looking for Oliver Lewis Way on your left. Turn left there, and continue on - that road becomes Newtown Pike.

If you need radio station suggestions for the drive, or would like a “Welcome to Kentucky” mix CD to make the drive more pleasant, give us a shout!
