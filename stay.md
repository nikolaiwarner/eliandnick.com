If all of these blocks fill up before you can book, let us know and we can suggest other options (like [__Airbnb__](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Lexington--KY?guests=2), which we personally use all the time for traveling, and __highly__ recommend). That said, please try to book ASAP if you need a hotel...we apparently chose a weekend where thereâ€™s a LOT going on in town (though our wedding is obviously the most important).
