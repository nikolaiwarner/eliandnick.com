![Floral Hall](/public/images/roundbarn.png)

Both the ceremony and reception will take place at the [historic Round Barn](http://www.theredmile.com/redmile/our-track/virtual-tour/round-barn) (aka [Floral Hall](http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/lexington/flo.htm)), located on the property of the Red Mile race track (1200 Red Mile Rd, Lexington, KY 40504). The ceremony will be held just outside the barn in a lovely field with Lexington’s downtown skyline in the background. We’ll take a break after for some photos and libations, and then head on into the barn to eat and dance the night away!


* __FOOD__ will be provided by the Red Mile’s in-house catering company, Bayou Bluegrass Catering. Get ready for some delicious Cajun-inspired eats!
> __PLEASE__ let us know ASAP if you or anyone in your party has specific dietary restrictions - we’re vegan and definitely
> know how much it sucks to be somewhere where you can’t eat anything (vegans and vegetarians - y'all know we've got your back on this wedding feast thang! y'all are gonna be all set!). But anything else...allergies, intolerances, what have you - even if you think we already know...remind us,
> please. [Click here to fill out a short form about your needs!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xijIxX8u_KMS4HHNuonFYEjLrXo4Rp-0Mb_KqjEbHfY/viewform)

* __THE BAR__ will feature some of our local delicacies - [Ale 8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ale-8-One), Kentucky’s favorite soda; [craft beer from one of Lexington's microbreweries, West Sixth Brewery](http://www.craftbeer.com/featured-brewery/west-sixth-brewing-company); and several varieties of [Kentucky’s gift to the rest of the world - bourbon!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey)

* __WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?__
Whatever makes you feel awesome, and lets you dance! If the weather is just horrible, we’ll move the whole shebang inside the barn, but otherwise, note that Kentucky weather is unpredictable and plan accordingly (ie - you might want to stash a sweater and/or an umbrella in the car, just in case). We’ll hope for blue skies with vibrant foliage and just a slight chill - but anything is possible! Also, ladies, if you’re cool with your sky-high stilettos digging into the grass as you walk across a field, then girl, rock those hot shoes! But also remember that the bride is a librarian and very much supports the idea of wearing comfortable footwear.

* __DANCY PARTY SONG REQUESTS:__
You can submit booty-shakin' song requests for the dance party [__RIGHT HERE__](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gRWS1Tq05aKgqhNKMSdVZyEexFCqHIZ7Ep4yYwHhsSc/viewform)!
