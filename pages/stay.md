We have rooms blocked off at two Lexington hotels between 10/17-10/20:

Springhill Suites Lexington Near the University of Kentucky
863 S Broadway Rd, Lexington, KY 40504
(859) 225-1500
$149/night
magic words: "Riveire/Warner wedding"

Griffin Gate Marriott Resort and Spa
1800 Newtown Pike, Lexington, KY 40511

$159/night
magic words: "Riveire/Warner wedding"
OR [use this link to book online](https://resweb.passkey.com/go/RIVEIREWARNERWEDDING).

If both of these blocks fill up before you can book, let us know and we can suggest other options. That said, please try to book ASAP if you need a hotel...we apparently chose a weekend where there’s a LOT going on in town (though our wedding is obviously the biggest).
