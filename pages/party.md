# PARTY
Both the ceremony and reception will take place at the historic Round Barn, located on the property of the Red Mile race track (1200 Red Mile Rd, Lexington, KY 40504). The ceremony will be held just outside* the barn in a lovely field with Lexington’s downtown skyline in the background. We’ll take a break after for some photos and libations, and then head on into the barn to eat and dance the night away!

* If the weather is just horrible, we’ll move the whole shebang inside the barn, but otherwise, note that Kentucky weather is unpredictable and plan accordingly. We’ll hope for blue skies with vibrant foliage and just a slight chill - but anything is possible! Also, ladies, if you’re cool with your sky-high stilettos digging into the grass as you walk across a field, then girl, rock those hot shoes! But also remember that the bride is a librarian and very much supports the idea of wearing comfortable footwear.

Food will be provided by the Red Mile’s in-house catering company, Bayou Bluegrass Catering. Get ready for some delicious Cajun-inspired eats! (And PLEASE let us know ASAP if you or anyone in your party has specific dietary restrictions - we’re vegan and definitely know how much it sucks to be somewhere where you can’t eat anything! Even if you think we already know...remind us, please.)

The bar will feature some of our local delicacies - Ale 8, Kentucky’s favorite soda; craft beer from one of Lexington microbreweries, West Sixth Brewing; and several varieties of Kentucky’s gift to the rest of the world - bourbon!
