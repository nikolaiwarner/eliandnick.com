# PLAY
While you’re here, get to know the Bluegrass a little better!

- Visit a distillery: In the area, Buffalo Trace (in Frankfort) and Four Roses (in Lawrenceberg) both give great FREE tours that end with tastings! All ages are welcome, though these might be more fun (and interesting) for those of age (especially since they basically end with free bourbon).
- If you’re staying at the Griffin Gate, you are just a stone’s throw away from the Legacy Trail, Lexington’s first (and currently, only) major walking, running, and biking trail. The trail runs about 8 miles, goes through a TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE INTERSTATE (!!!!!!!!!!!!) and connects the Northside YMCA in Lexington to the Kentucky Horse Park, near Georgetown. Strap on your shoes and head out for some fresh air!
- Those with little ones might want to hit the Explorium and the Living Arts and Science Center (both in downtown Lexington) for some creative learni....uhhhh...I mean...creative fun!
- Go hang at the Bread Box and visit West Sixth Brewing. The beer’s delicious, they’re usually hosting some tasty food truck, they serve Ale 8 for our underage friends, and it’s truly the only “bar” in town where it’s cool to bring your whole family. You might get lucky and chance upon the building, which used to be a Rainbo Bread factory, at a good time to catch the local roller derby team’s practice, or perhaps an open studio event at one of the artists’ spaces. It’s one of our favorite places in town.
- Get out into nature - the Arboretum, Raven Run Nature Sanctuary, and even Woodland Park (technically, the site of Eli and Nick’s first date) all offer nearby opportunities for outdoor fun.
- If you get lucky and it’s actually open, drive all the way out Tates Creek Rd. to the Valley View Ferry. Ride it across the Kentucky River, turn around on the other side, and ride back. Amazing! And free! (Yes, we’re easily amused.)
