# A MODERN LOVE STORY

We met for the very first time in the spring of 2005 - during Eli’s sophomore year and Nick’s junior year at the University of Kentucky. Eli was walking into WRFL, UK’s college radio station where she and Nick were both individually involved, with her friend and fellow Telecom major, Bob Zuercher. Eli and Bob opened the back door, and found Nick flying wildly around the CD library on a Razor Scooter (yes, a Razor Scooter). He yelled out, “Hiiiii!!” as he passed by the door, and continued on his lap of the station.

In the fall of 2005, we met again - Eli became the WRFL Office Assistant and started attending weekly Director’s Meetings with Nick, who was the WRFL Webmaster (locals may remember the glory days when the [website had a beard](http://web.archive.org/web/20060208040252/http://wrfl881.org/)). The spark of love was ignited over dance parties, campus anti-war protests (Eli likes to think of Jens Lekman’s [I Saw Her in the Anti-War Demostration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYs6-Sb4NLI) as one of our special songs), mid-day walks to work, and finally, a complete day spent together at Woodland Park eating popsicles and lying on the grass watching the clouds pass. We became inseparable, and our love was solidified during an RFL-sponsored trip to Kansas City for a college radio conference. Upon returning to Lexington, Nick put our love in display in the form of graffiti in the infamous WRFL bathroom - a heart containing the couple’s names, just across from the toilet (and that evidence of true love is still there today, later adorned by a quote from Oscar Wilde!).

Six-and-a-half year later (a span of time including two bachelors degrees [both in Telecommunications!], a masters degree, three shared apartments, both of our siblings’ weddings, the births of the [world’s best niece and nephew](http://instagram.com/p/VkMPqkLH_8/), countless cuddles from the best cat on the planet (Sabie Butters...how can you not fall in love with a man who names his cat [Sabie Butters](http://instagram.com/p/TGL29DLHzr/)?!), and several world-class performances with own own bands and other local groups), that love was still going strong!

> __Cut to late July, 2012.__ Eli and Nick are preparing dinner in their Bell Court apartment kitchen. The food being prepared is probably something delicious. They are talking:  

> Eli and Nick: Hey...do you think we should get married?  
> Both: YES!


Knowing that we were travelling to San Diego a few weeks later for the Society of American Archivists annual conference (let’s not forget, Eli had recently gotten her MLS and was seriously job-searching), we made a plan to buy each other badass engagement rings (why shouldn’t the dude get some bling too?), and propose to each other officially on some romantic Southern California beach.

We decided to take a day before the conference started, and drive up California’s Pacific Coast Highway until landing on the perfect spot. With the help and advice of Eli’s longtime family friend Callie Ullman (who had graciously offered us a room in her San Diego-area home AND the use of her (quite sexy, really) Audi), we set off on Sunday morning, August 5th. After a lovely day of driving up the coast, and stopping in Santa Monica for a delicious vegan meal (and no, we didn’t see Larry David, though we looked), we realized we would be approaching Malibu just before sunset.

The light was exquisite, and the salty ocean smelled heavenly. We walked down the warm sand at [Point Dume State Beach](https://www.google.com/search?q=point+dume+state+beach&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=yzP&tbo=d&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=5zIdUfnVK-au0AHPooDwDA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=606) until finding the perfect spot. After exchanging some sweet words, we asked each other to spend the rest of our lives together (and by the way, we both said YES, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!), and slipped beautiful rings on each other’s fingers - just as the [sunset](http://instagram.com/p/UAN9OnLHxD/) hit its crescendo. We spent a few moments alone together, before texting a photo of [our rings](http://instagram.com/p/N_hx4OrH8T/) to our parents (who all thought, seeing Nick’s ring, that we had eloped!), and then announcing it to our friends through [Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/N-J9APLH5t/) and Facebook.

We made our way back to San Diego, high on excitement and adrenaline. Just as we were passing Disney World in Anaheim, the park’s nightly fireworks erupted (how did they know?!), brilliantly visible from the I-5.

> Sidenote - After returning, we finally crawled into bed around 2am. Just four hours later, at 6am CST
> Monday morning (9am in Lexington), Eli’s phone rang - it was the Lexington Public Library’s Central
> branch manager offering her a full-time position as an Adult Services Librarian (her very first
> post-MLS professional position). California proved to be a very lucky place for this couple!

Later in the fall of 2012, we decided to plant our roots firmly in Lexington by buying a house - on Halloween, we closed on a [very sweet 85-year-old Dutch Colonial Revival-style home near Castlewood Park](http://instagram.com/p/QD_VSOrH9N/); and moved in early January 2013. On October 19, 2013, (exactly one week before our 8th anniversary), we will formally commit our lives to one another, legally binding what our hearts have felt for years. We can’t wait to share this moment with all of you!
